# R2C2_BEXUS_Simulations/Simulation_code 

The process starts in the file main.py 
There the size and shape of the caff container and the dipoles is defined, as well as the number of dipoles to simulate. The initial conditions for the dipoles are generated by calling initial_conditions.py. With these values a set of dipoles is generated. each dipole is an instance of the class ChaffPiece from chaff_class.py. Each inscance knows all the values specific to this one chaff piece.

single_chaff_motion.py is the start of the file containing the functions for the actual simulation of the motion of single dipoles. The concept is described both in the SED Appendix E and in Knott et al.'s "Chaff Theoretical/Analytical Characterization and Validation Program".

Reynolds_Number.py is a start for the generation of the Reynoldy number, the angle of attack and the drag coefficient of a single chaff piece. It is based on the concept described in Knott et al.'s "Chaff Theoretical/Analytical Characterization and Validation Program". Unfortunately it is not yet finished as the right lookup tables are missing. 

lookup_table.py contains the lookup table given in Brunk et al.'s "Chaff Aerodynamics". Unfortunately they are in an unfitting range of Raynolds Number and will have to be extendedto proove useful.
